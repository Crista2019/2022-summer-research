region string, -- brain region

nexciting integer, -- number of cells this cell monosynaptically excited

ninhibiting integer, -- number of cells this cell monosynaptically inhibited

exciting integer, -- physiologically identified exciting cells based on CCG analysis

inhibiting integer, -- physiologically identified inhibiting cells based on CCG analysis (Detailed method can be found in Mizuseki Sirota Pastalkova and Buzsaki., 2009 Neuron paper.) 

excited integer, -- based on cross-correlogram analysis, the cell is monosynaptically excited by other cells
